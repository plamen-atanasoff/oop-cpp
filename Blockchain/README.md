This project implements a simple blockchain environment with users, transactions and transaction blocks. There is a System user who manages the creation and deletion of users using the user database(the user database is a binary file). Every user has a unique id and a wallet. Users are required to invest a sum to create an account, can send each other money and can delete their account if they want to. Every transaction has the id of the sender and the receiver, the amount of money sent and the time at which the transaction was completed. The transaction block holds up to 16 transactions, it's id and the previous block hash. There is a functionality to validate that the blockchain has not been tampered by comparing the hashes of the blocks. All of the transaction blocks are stored in a binary file allowing the data to be used after the end of the program. There are also functions to sort the richest users or the biggest blocks and write them to a text file.
